# This configuration includes the default, minimal set of hooks to be
# run on all commits. It requires no specific setup and one can just
# start using pre-commit with it.
#
# See .pre-commit-config-all.yaml for a more complete one that comes
# with a better coverage at the cost of some specific setup needed.
